# Simple-Screenshot
A python program to take screenshots across 2 monitors and upload to https://litterbox.catbox.moe/

![Example Video](https://files.catbox.moe/zdyshi.gif)


Takes a screenshot of your desktop, opens it as a fullscreen image, and allows you to drag out an area to crop. Saves the cropped image on your computer, uploads it, copies the link, and opens it in your browser.


Just install the requirements and run `main.pyw`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Your milage may vary, it should work if your set up is similar to mine (dual monitors, same size).

Made for fun and because gyazo has been very slow. Tested on Windows only.
